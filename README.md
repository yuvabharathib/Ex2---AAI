<h1 align =center>Implementation of Exact Inference Method of Bayesian Network</h1>

## Aim:
To implement the inference Burglary P(B| j,⥗m) in alarm problem by using Variable Elimination method in Python.

## Algorithm:

Step 1: Define the Bayesian Network structure for alarm problem with 5 random variables, Burglary,Earthquake,John Call,Mary Call and Alarm.<br>
Step 2: Define the Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) for each variable using the TabularCPD class from the pgmpy library.<br>
Step 3: Add the CPDs to the network.<br>
Step 4: Initialize the inference engine using the VariableElimination class from the pgmpy library.<br>
Step 5: Define the evidence (observed variables) and query variables.<br>
Step 6: Perform exact inference using the defined evidence and query variables.<br>
Step 7: Print the results.<br>

## Program :

## Output :

## Result :
Thus, Bayesian Inference was successfully determined using Variable Elimination Method
